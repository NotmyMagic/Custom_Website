            <p>
              A good defense is a good offense. Warriors are one of the
              strongest classes in the game, they can take huge punishment from
              their enemies and walk away without a scratch. Their multiple
              crowd control abilities and natural defense makes warriors a
              formidable foe.

            <a href="./Class_options/Archer.html"><h3>Archer</h3></a>
            <p>
              Precision is the key to victory. The archer sits comfortably at
              range to decimate their enemies with powerful projectiles. Evading
              and dodging enemies attacks is crucial to the playstyle of this
              class. Archers dish out huge amounts of damage, but aren’t so
              adept at defending themselves.

            <p>
              Knowledge is power. Mages are naturally talented in the mystical
              arts, not only can they produce powerful incantations to destroy
              enemies, they can also heal allies and protect their friends.
              Although alone mages are not the most powerful, they are a
              valuable asset to any team.

            <a href="./Class_options/Assassin.html"><h3>Assassin</h3></a>
            <p>
              The unseen is the deadliest foe. The assassin uses their various
              stealth spells to swiftly and seamlessly vanquish their opponents.
              From the shadows they are able to strike multiple times before
              their enemy knows what hit them. In a duel with an Assassin, one
              should watch their back…. And their front.

            <a href="./Class_options/Shaman.html"><h3>Shaman</h3></a>
            <p>
              The Shaman benefits from powerful buffs, displacement, and
              crowd-control abilities at the cost of low defences. Using spell
              combinations, they can aggressively engage large amounts of
              enemies or simply sit back and support their team.
